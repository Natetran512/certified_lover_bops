                       <p>Well I already missed the once-a-week thing huh. But you know what, this is close enough to once a week; I just missed it by one day. Anyways, to be honest, I haven't been really doing much this week besides sleeping and listening to music. Actually, I started playing a little League of Legends. I hate it. 
                       </p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Website Update</h2>
                       <p>I spent 90% of the week thinking about what I wanted to improve and then the other 10% actually doing it. First off, I finally found the class that caused a line between the header and the actual page content on the home page so that's nice. You probably won't see what it looked like before. The one major change that came this week was a new page that's called music. It's basically a bunch of album reviews that I'll go more into depth later.</p>
                       <p>I wanted to try to use hover properties for an image in css in order to have text display whenever the user hovered over it. Since I barely know anything about web design, I once again went to my very smart aquaintance to help me out. What he gave me was a bit out of my scope, so I tried to simplify it and just mess around until I got something I liked. It's not perfect, but I'm content with how the page turned out. </p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Album Reviewer</h2>
                       <p>So as many of you may know, I'm a pretty big music nerd. Specifically, I listen to a lot of kpop. With the summer comebacks going on, my group of friends decided to rank/score each song of comebacks (e.g. fromis_9, chungha, wjsn, etc). One of my friends ended up finding an article that listed the supposedly "25 best kpop albums of the 2010s." He sent it to me asking for my opinion, to which I responded with I haven't heard it or it shouldn't be there. </p>
                       <p>With that, we decided to rank those albums ourselves to see if they truly deserved the spot of top album of the decade. It started with just albums from the list, but we began to pick albums that we wanted to personally review as well as take requests from our friends. Through this process I've discovered some songs that I like that I never knew about before. Also I solidified that NCT's sticker is a NOT GOOD out of 10. I'm probably gonna spend a good amount of the summer just reviewing albums with my friend for fun because I enjoy that typa thing.  </p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">College Apps Update???</h2>
                       <p>I wrote a decent amount last time, but to be honest there's not much to talk about this time. I finished drafting my Stanford supplementals but decided to look over them again for a second draft. I realized that my second drafts were wayyyyy better than my first ones so I think I'm gonna do that for the rest of the supplementals/essays. I also ended up writing one of my short answers about BTS lmao. I'm lowkey behind compared to where I wanted to be but oh well, I'll be fine (I hope). </p>
                       <p>Slightly over a week from today, I'm gonna be travelling to the east coast to look at some colleges, so hopefully I can get inspiration while I'm there. I gotta get the manifestation of doing MIT essays while sitting on campus in Cambridge. I might have an opportunity to meet with a CMU professor as well, so that will be pretty cool. </p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">DREAMCATCHER IN 3</h2>
                       <p>I kinda forgot about it for a bit, but then my sister reminded me. I can't believe I'm seeing Dreamcatcher in 3 days. They're one of my favorite groups and release such good music. It's gonna be hype seeing them live. The friend I'm going with bought the hi-wave thingy so I think they'll be able to see Dreamcatcher up close! I kinda envy them, but it's kinda expensive and I didn't want to leave my sister alone. I'm probably gonna record hella videos while I'm there and will definitely write about it in next week's post. </p>
